## Monad Sync Status Monitoring via Telegram 

- Telegram-Based Block Height Monitoring tool for `fullnodes` and `validator` nodes
  - Fetches the latest block height from your Monad node
  - Sends it as a Telegram message to dedicated channel
  - Checks the node's sync status automatically
  - No dashboards. No browser needed.
  - Just a clean, systemd or cron-backed heartbeat notification from your node ‚Äî straight to Telegram.

### üéØGetting started

- Download the repository
    ```aiignore
    git clone https://github.com/cosmostation/monad-sync-monitoring.git
    ```
- Inside the directory build the binary
    ```aiignore
    # build the binary
    cd monad-sync-monitoring && make build
    ```
- Set the `.env` file
  ```aiignore
  cd monad-sync-monitoring
  mv .env.sample .env
  ```
- Update the `.env` file with Telegram Bot Token and Telegram Private Chat ID 
  ```aiignore
  vim .env
  
  TELEGRAM_TOKEN=804xxxx:AAEymFxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=-38xxxxxx
  RPC_PORT=8080  # default

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable monad-monitoring.service
  sudo systemctl start monad-monitoring.service

### Expected Outcome

- The following example screenshot shows a Telegram bot called `Monad Status Bot` actively monitoring and reporting the status of a Monad node. The messages are timestamped and use emojis to indicate different statuses.

- üìäSummary of Bot Behavior:
  - ‚úÖUP 
    - Message: Monad RPC is back UP! Current height: `<height>`
    - Emoji: ‚úÖ 
    - Indicates the node is responsive again.

  - ‚ö†Ô∏èStuck 
    - Message: Monad node seems stuck at height: `<height>`
    - Emoji: ‚ö†Ô∏è 
    - Indicates the node is reachable but not advancing in block height.

  - ‚ùå DOWN 
    - Message: Monad RPC is DOWN! Unable to connect to port. 
    - Emoji: üõë (red square with X)
    - Indicates the node is unreachable‚Äîpossibly network or process failure.
